Simple topology with 1 client and 1 UDP server connected on one OpenFlow-enabled switch.
The controller requests flow-statistics every 30sec.

The simulation run for 250 seconds.
In the [General] scenario no attack is performed within the network.

In the [Simple_Attack],the compromised client starts the attack at simulation time 90s based 
on the instructions written in the 'simple_attack.xml'. 

Attack Description:
===================
The attack is described in the .adl file. Compile it to .xml by running the './run_simple_attack.sh' bash script.

OBS
===
The current network has been built using FlatnetworkConfigurator. The implementation of the project has not been tested under IPv4NetworkConfigurator module.
