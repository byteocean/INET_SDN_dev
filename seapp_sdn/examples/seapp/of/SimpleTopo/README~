Simple topology with one client and one UDP server connected in one OpenFlow-enabled switch.

Uncommenting the line 
	#**.attackConfigurationFile = "simple_attack.xml"
in the configuration file, the attack will start.
 
The compromised client starts the attack at simulation time 25s. 
Based on the configuration, the attack will be detected at t=30 and all traffic between the client and the server will be dropped.
